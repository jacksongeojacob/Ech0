### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For as long as humans have built machines, we’ve dreamed of speaking to them as if they were one of us.  
But machines don’t think in the rhythm of our voices, the warmth of our words, or the poetry of our sentences.  
They speak in patterns, in pulses, in the unyielding logic of zero and one.  

In the early days, humans learned to bridge this gap — turning thought into code, and code into action.  
From the clattering of telegraph machines sending dots and dashes across oceans, to modern processors interpreting streams of binary, the story has always been the same:  
we translate our messy, emotional language into something a machine can understand.  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
**Ech0** is a modern take on that ancient conversation.  
You speak in your voice — rich, imperfect, human.  
The system listens, captures your words, and transforms them into *Hex*, a shorthand for human readability of binary code that even the simplest of machines could understand over a century ago.
It then converts these hexadecimal values into pulses of certain frequencies, allowing us humans to hear their voices.

It’s not just a tool — it’s a bridge between eras, between worlds.  
Where human emotion meets mechanical logic, where sound becomes pattern, and where conversation takes on a timeless pulse.

### *Hexadecimal Frequency Mappings*

The application uses a predefined set of audio frequencies for each of the 16 hexadecimal characters. When the bot's response is converted to hex, each character in the resulting string is played as a pure sine wave tone at its assigned frequency.

Here is the complete set of mappings:

* **0**: 400 Hz
* **1**: 450 Hz
* **2**: 500 Hz
* **3**: 550 Hz
* **4**: 600 Hz
* **5**: 650 Hz
* **6**: 700 Hz
* **7**: 750 Hz
* **8**: 800 Hz
* **9**: 850 Hz
* **A**: 900 Hz
* **B**: 950 Hz
* **C**: 1000 Hz
* **D**: 1050 Hz
* **E**: 1100 Hz
* **F**: 1150 Hz

## Technical Details
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs:** Gemini API, Web Audio API

### Implementation
The JavaScript file handles all the core logic, including microphone input, generating hexadecimal tone sequences, and managing the UI for theme and transcription toggles.
Just click the mic icon and start talking!
